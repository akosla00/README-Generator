Using two js files, one to generate a markdown readme file, and another to use node npms to ask questions and get information to generate the markdown file, we're able to run node index.js and answer the questions using the inquirer npm.
After the questions have been answered, the inputs from the answers are used to generate a professional, and organized README.md file.
